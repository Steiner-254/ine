# Introduction

## The Information Security Field

Pentesting career, supported by:

- knowing the information security (**`infosec`**) field
- career opportunities
- talking with colleagues

### InfoSec Culture

Deep roots in the underground hacking scene.

**`Hacker`** = refers to people who prefer to understand how a system works, being curious, intelligent and motivated to pursue knowledge.

Usually a hacker approaches systems with curiosity, so he can:

- Find new ways to use computer systems
- Bypass imposed restrictions
- Understand security pitfalls

*Performing an attack* means to **understand** the technology and the functioning of the target system.

*Being a Hacker* means **improving** skills everyday, pushed by **curiosity** and hunger for **knowledge**.

> ðŸ“• There is always something new to learn!

*Hacking* is more of an approach, a lifestyle.

*Being an InfoSec professional* means pursuing knowledge by keeping challenging yourself and your colleagues, being honest with yourself and never stop. 

- To have an idea about the ideals of the underground hacking community read [The Conscience of a Hacker](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html).

### Career Opportunities

Companies and government bodies are using advanced tech to store and process confidential data. Using hacking skills for good has become critical for the safety of nations too.

*Data is transmitted* across private & public networks. It is a **must** to:

- **Protect sensitive information**
- Implement hardware and software defensive systems
- Protect `digital assets` from major **cyber-threats** like:
  - global cyber syndicates
  - hackers for hire
  - hacktivists
  - terrorists
  - state-sponsored hackers

*Train the organization* to make sure:

- secure applications are developed
- proper defensive measures are taken
- proper use of the company's data is in place

*Hire a penetration tester* to ensure that a system is secure from cyber-attacks.

`Penetration Testers` (a.k.a. **`pentesters`**) = are professionals hired to simulate a hacking attack against a network, a computer system, a web application or the entire organization. They discover vulnerabilities across the tested systems by mastering the same tools and techniques used by malicious hackers. They often work:

- as freelancers
- in an IT Security services company
- as in-house employees

Pentesters can specialize in specific InfoSec sectors:

- Systems attacks
- Web Applications
- Malware Analysis
- Reverse Engineering
- Mobile Applications
- Network Pentesting
- Social Engineering
- Other...

> ðŸ“Œ Be passionate, skilled and hungry for knowledge!

### Information Security Terms

It is fundamental to speak the InfoSec domain language.

**`WHITE HAT HACKER`**

- is a professional pentester or ***ethical hacker*** who performs *authorized* attacks against a system helping the client *solve* their security issues.
- they do NOT perform illegal actions

**`BLACK HAT HACKER`**

- is a hacker who performs *unauthorized* attacks against a system with the purpose of *causing damage* or gaining *profit*.
- a category of black hat hackers is called "*crackers*".

**`USER`**

- is a computer system user (an employee of your client of an external user)

**`MALICIOUS USER`**

- is a user who *misuses* or *attacks* computer systems and applications.

**`ROOT / ADMINISTATOR`**

- are the users who manage IT networks or single systems.
- they have *maximum privileges* over a system.

**`PRIVILEGES`**

- identify the action that a user is *allowed* to do.
- the higher the privileges, the more control.

**`SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY`**

- is the use of *secrecy of design*, implementation or configuration in order to provide security.
- it *cannot stop* a skilled and motivated attacker.

**`ATTACK`**

- is any kind of action aimed at *misusing* or *taking control* over a computer system or application.
  - unauthorized access to an administration area
  - stealing a user's credentials
  - causing denial of service
  - eavesdropping or communications

**`PRIVILEGE ESCALATION`**

- **`privesc`** is an attack where a malicious user *gains elevated privileges* over a system.

**`DENIAL OF SERVICE`**

- a **`DoS attack`** is used by an attacker to make a system or a service unavailable / unresponsive, causing a service crash or resources saturation.

**`REMOTE CODE EXECUTION`**

- during a **`RCE attack`** a malicious user executes some attacker-controlled *code* on a victim *remote* machine.
- RCE vulnerabilities can be *exploited* over the network by a remote attacker.

**`SHELL CODE`**

- is a piece of custom code which provides the attacker a **`shell`** on the victim machine, generally used during RCE attacks.
