Deep roots in the underground hacking scene.

**`Hacker`** = refers to people who prefer to understand how a system works, being curious, intelligent and motivated to pursue knowledge.

Usually a hacker approaches systems with curiosity, so he can:

- Bypass imposed restrictions
- Understand security pitfalls

*Performing an attack* means to **understand** the technology and the functioning of the target system.

*Being a Hacker* means **improving** skills everyday, pushed by **curiosity** and hunger for **knowledge**.

> ðŸ“• There is always something new to learn!

*Hacking* is more of an approach, a lifestyle.

*Being an InfoSec professional* means pursuing knowledge by keeping challenging yourself and your colleagues, being honest with yourself and never stop.
