# Introduction

## The Information Security Field

Pentesting career, supported by:

- knowing the information security (**`infosec`**) field
- career opportunities
- talking with colleagues

### InfoSec Culture

Deep roots in the underground hacking scene.

**`Hacker`** = refers to people who prefer to understand how a system works, being curious, intelligent and motivated to pursue knowledge.

Usually a hacker approaches systems with curiosity, so he can:

- Find new ways to use computer systems
- Bypass imposed restrictions
- Understand security pitfalls

*Performing an attack* means to **understand** the technology and the functioning of the target system.

*Being a Hacker* means **improving** skills every day, pushed by **curiosity** and hunger for **knowledge**.

> ðŸ“• There is always something new to learn!

*Hacking* is more of an approach, a lifestyle.

*Being an InfoSec professional* means pursuing knowledge by keeping challenging yourself and your colleagues, being honest with yourself and never stop. 

- To have an idea about the ideals of the underground hacking community read [The Conscience of a Hacker](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html).

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

### Career Opportunities

Companies and government bodies are using advanced tech to store and process confidential data. Using hacking skills for good has become critical for the safety of nations too.

*Data is transmitted* across private & public networks. It is a **must** to:

- **Protect sensitive information**
- Implement hardware and software defensive systems
- Protect `digital assets` from major **cyber-threats** like:
  - global cyber syndicates
  - hackers for hire
  - hacktivists
  - terrorists
  - state-sponsored hackers

*Train the organization* to make sure:

- secure applications are developed
- proper defensive measures are taken
- proper use of the company's data is in place

*Hire a penetration tester* to ensure that a system is secure from cyber-attacks.

**`Penetration Testers`** (a.k.a. **`pentesters`**) = are professionals hired to simulate a hacking attack against a network, a computer system, a web application or the entire organization. They discover vulnerabilities across the tested systems by mastering the same tools and techniques used by malicious hackers. They often work:

- as freelancers
- in an IT Security services company
- as in-house employees

Pentesters can specialize in specific InfoSec sectors:

- Systems attacks
- Web Applications
- Malware Analysis
- Reverse Engineering
- Mobile Applications
- Network Pentesting
- Social Engineering
- Other...

> ðŸ“Œ Be passionate, skilled and hungry for knowledge!

------

**`MALICIOUS USER`**

- is a user who *misuses* or *attacks* computer systems and applications.

------

**`ROOT / ADMINISTRATOR`**

- are the users who manage IT networks or single systems.

------

**`PRIVILEGES`**

- identify the action that a user is *allowed* to do.
- the higher the privileges, the more control.

------

**`SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY`**

- is the use of *secrecy of design*, implementation or configuration in order to provide security.

------

**`PRIVILEGE ESCALATION`**

- **`privesc`** is an attack where a malicious user *gains elevated privileges* over a system.

------
