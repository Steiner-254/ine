# Web Applications

- **`Web applications`** are software that runs on web servers and are accessible via web browsers.
- The web app world is heterogeneous, since every web app can be differently developed to accomplish the same task.
- This great flexibility in development results in more flexibility in creating insecure code and messing things up.

**`HTTP`** (**H**ypertext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) is one of the most used application protocol on the Internet, built on top of TCP.

- It is the **client-server protocol** used to transfer web pages and web application data.
- Is is a **stateless** protocol.
- The client (a web browser) connects to a web server (usually Microsoft IIS, Apache HTTP Server, or others) by sending HTTP **requests** to the server and getting back HTTP **responses**.
- First a TCP connection is established, then the HTTP messages are sent.

### HTTP Requests

| *The structure of an HTTP message* |
| ---------------------------------- |
| "**Start line**\r\n"               |
| "**Headers**\r\n"                  |
| "\r\n"                             |
| "**Message Body**\r\n"             |

- **`"\r\n"`** (carriage return & newline) are used to the lines in HTTP.

- Each start-line contains 3 elements:

  1. an `HTTP method` (verb/noun) that states the type of the request, like: GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS
  2. the `request target` (URL/path), which resource the browser is asking for
  3. the *protocol version* (`HTTP/1.x`)which defines the structure of the remaining message, telling the server how to communicate with the browser

  ```http
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  ```

- Each header is represented in a single line, composed of a String followed by a colon (**:**) and a value:

  - *Header-name: value*

  ```http
  Host: example.com
  Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36
  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
  Connection: close
  
  (body)
  ```
  
  - The `Host` value is obtained from the URI (**U**niform **R**esource **I**dentifier) of the resource.
  - `User-Agent` - reveals the client software issuing the request (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, mobile app ...) and the operating system version.
  - `Accept` - expected document type.

### HTTP Responses

The web server *processes the request and sends an HTTP response* back to the client:

  - The start-line, called the **`status-line`**, contains the protocol version, a status code and a status text.
  - HTTP headers same as above, different headers may appear, such as:
    - `Cache-Control` - informs the client about cached content (saves bandwidth)
    - `Content-Type` - lets the client know how to interpret the body
    - `Server` - header of the web server, software running (useful in pentesting!)
    - `Content-Length` - length in bytes of the message body

  - The `body` is separated from the header by 2 empty lines (\r\n\r\n).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Age: 259261
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

- Common status codes:

|          Status code          | Meaning                                                      |
| :---------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|          **200** OK           | the request has succeeded (***Successful codes 2xx***)       |
|   **301** Moved Permanently   | the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI (***Redirection codes 3xx***) |
|         **302** Found         | the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI (Redirection codes 3xx) |
|       **403** Forbidden       | the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it, client doesn't have enough privileges (***Client Error codes 4xx***) |
|       **404** Not Found       | the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists (Client Error codes 4xx) |
| **500** Internal Server Error | the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request (***Server Error codes 5xx***) |
|      **502** Bad Gateway      | the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request (Server Error codes 5xx) |

## HTTPS Protocol Basics

HTTP (a clear-text protocol) can be protected using an **encryption** layer, by using a *cryptographic protocol* like SSL/TLS.

**`HTTPS`** (HTTP Secure) is a method to run HTTP over SSL/TLS. 

- This encryption layer protects data exchanged between the client and the server, but it does *not protect against web application flaws*. XSS and SQL injections attack will still work.
- It provides **confidentiality**, **integrity protection** and **authentication** to the HTTP protocol.
- Application layer communication cannot be sniffed or altered by an eventual attacker.
- Traffic can be sniffed and inspected by a user, but he cannot know HTTP headers, body, target domain or what data is exchanged.
  - Target IP address and target port can be recongnized
  - DNS (or similar protocols) may disclose which domain user tries to resolve

### Netcat

**`netcat`** or **`nc`** is a tool that reads and writes data accross network connections (opens a raw connection to a service port for example), using TCP or UDP protocol.

- considered as a Swiss army knife of networking tools
- used to debug and monitor network connections, scan for open ports, transfer data, listen for incoming connections (reverse shells) and more

**`nc -h`**

- Check if a port is opened:

> - **`nc -zv HOST PORT#`**
>   - **-z** performs a port scan against a given host and port or port range.
>
> ```bash
> $ nc -zv my.ine.com 443 
> DNS fwd/rev mismatch: my.ine.com != server-143-204-98-103.fra50.r.cloudfront.net

### Burp Suite

**`Burp Suite`** is an integrated platform and graphical tool for performing security testing of web apps, by testing, mapping and analyze the application's attack surface.

- it is written in Java, developed by [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/).
- can be used as proxy server, scanner, intruder, repeater, spider, decoder, comparer, sequencer, extender and more.

Using the ***Repeater*** tool:

- Example of a GET request on port 80:
![](.gitbook/assets/image-20220412002111740.png)
- Example of a *301 Moved Permanently* response and redirection:
  - 301 response received:
  ![](.gitbook/assets/image-20220412002857935.png)
  - By clicking the **`Follow redirection`** button, it follows the redirection (to the *Location*) in the current response without manually modifying the request to the target domain. I this case it got redirected to the HTTPS page:
