## Vulnerabilities

üóíÔ∏è A **vulnerability** is *a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.* When exploited, it results in a negative impact to `confidentiality`, `integrity` or `availability`.

- **`Physical layer`** - `e.g.` physical controls, vaults, door locks, gates, fences, cameras, etc. There can be vulnerabilities in those as well.
- Vulnerabilities on a computer comes from the operating system, systems and installed services, found by *DevSec engineers, Security researches, Pentesters, Software developers, Users.*
- [**NVD** (**N**ational **V**ulnerability **D**atabase)](https://nvd.nist.gov/general) - a United States government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the **SCAP** (**S**ecurity **C**ontent **A**utomation **P**rotocol), maintained by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/).
- All vulnerabilities in the NVD have been assigned a CVE identifier.

üóíÔ∏è The [**`CVE`** (**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures)](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/cve-process) program is a public glossary of vulnerabilities identified for specific code bases, software applications or open libraries, maintained by MITRE corporation. A unique **CVE ID** is primarily assigned by MITRE or by **CNAs** (**C**VE **N**umbering **A**uthorities), allowing stakeholders, vendors and researchers to commonly identify unique or new exploits and vulnerabilities.

- **`E.g.`** - high impact, critical vulnerabilities:
  - [CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160)
  - [CVE-2017-0143 - EternalBlue](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0143)
  - [CVE-2021-44228 - Apache Log4j](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
