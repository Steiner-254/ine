# eJPT Certification





Keep your company's or teams' meeting notes in one place. Indexable, searchable and deep-linkable (yes, that's a word).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** GitBook is a great place to document your team's meetings, giving folks access to documentation from every meeting. This template is structured in a way that gives collaborative, open note-taking centre stage. There's no reason why you can't use it for private or personal meeting notes though!
