**Good to know:** it's always good to keep a record of who attended meetings, who was facilitating the meeting, and who was designated as the lucky person to take notes. A 'Users' column type in a table lets you quickly add any member of your organization to a column, making tracking this a breeze!

**Good to know:** Having clear action items from any meeting can make the difference between practical and pointless. Focus on meeting outcomes, even if it's just to generate a bunch of work.
